##  About Hooba
Good day to all!
In today's world it is crazy with what one can do and achieve with technology when he/she puts their mind to it. 
We have witnessed greatness over the past few years through bitcoin and blockchain technology.
Our world is truly advancing rapidly and there is no better time to start then now.

Before I introduce to you what we aim to do I would like you to go over the following with an open mind, try to encapsulate my vision here and where we are going with it.
- What are NFT's?(If you do not know what they are please search it up on GOOGLE :P)
- What is art? Music, Poems, Literature and many more are art too!
- What makes this so valuable?
- Why do so much people want this?
- How do I get involved?
- I want to talk to the aritst!
- I want to know the story behind this masterpiece!
- I want to know the people who share the same interest as me!
- I love the collection of this guy/girl I want to chat with him!

Isn't it true that what truly drives the value of art isn't just its monetary value alone but its sentimental value too and underlying reasons for the creation of that piece.
Now picture a community where all of these questions can be discussed freely, all the friends you could meet, all the partnerships, opportunities, and creative minds gathered within
the Hub. The story behind the masterpieces of the world, the trending topics of the day, the millions of people sparking conversations and discussions on what interests them.
It is a paradise where one can truly express his/her mind and showcase it to the entire world.
Ahhh now this is truly an art lovers paradise, but it dosen't stop there! Trust me when I say this is for everyone.

Welcome to Hooba!
Hooba's vision is a website where YOU the people are the ones who drive our community.
But hatatatat we'll stop right there...

Hooba is open source so feel free to let your creativity sweep you off of your feet!
